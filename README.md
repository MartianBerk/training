<h3>Codewars</h3>
Using this site to tackle Python and Javascript problems. All solutions are submitted through their site.

<h3>The Odin Project</h3>
Less about problem solving, more about tutorials to follow Javascript fundamentals and web development.

<h3>Exercism</h3>
C++ problems. They provide a CLI which I have installed to complete the problem, test and submit. Each problem will need these steps performed:

``` shell
exercism download --track=cpp --exercise=NAME. # download the exercise
cmake Xcode .  # compile the solution
exercism test  # run tests
exercism submit  # submit
```

<h3>Advent of Code</h3>
Solve each of the problems provided by the site. Rather than actual code submissions, the site accepts only the answer to the problem. The code is written to solve the problem.

<h3>Project Euler</h4>
Solve each of the problems provided by the site. Rather than actual code submissions, the site accepts only the answer to the problem. The code is written to solve the problem. As C++ exercises, compile with g++

``` shell
g++ SOLUTION.cpp -o SOLUTION
```
